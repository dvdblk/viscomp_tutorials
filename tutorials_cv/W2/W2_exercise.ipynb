    "# Week 2: Background subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This python notebook includes all the exercises from this session. All the needed setup, I/O and user-interaction code is already provided to let you concentrate on this week's topic.<br>\n",
    "Please run all the provided code in order before running yours.<br>\n",

    "## 1. Bluescreen\n",
    "### 1.A Single pixel model\n",
    "Extract foreground objects in bluescreen movie footage. The blue background color should be specified by a single color value [r, g, b]. You may obtain such a value by using the provided notebook widget to select one or more blue pixels on the first frame of the footage. To determine whether a given pixel should be foreground or background, threshold the absolute distance of its value to the reference value, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left\\lVert[r, g, b] − [r_0, g_0, b_0]\\right\\rVert < t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on pixelwise decisions, a mask can be created to specify foreground and background.<br>\n",
    "Try different values for the threshold and the reference color. To test your results, you can use the short video provided. Note that not the whole background consists of bluescreen.\n",
    "To overcome this problem, you can use the precomputed mask provided into the variable `mask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.B Exemplar set model\n",
    "To further improve the results, specify the blue background by an exemplar set of blue background pixels. You may select this set using the same widget as in the previous point. After computing mean $\\mu$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ of the pixel values, the Mahalanobis distance $M(x, \\mu, \\Sigma)$ can be used to decide whether a color value $x$ originated from the background or the foreground.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M(x, \\mu, \\Sigma) = \\sqrt{(x-\\mu)^T\\Sigma^{-1}(x-\\mu)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Per-pixel Model\n",
    "Probably you have noticed that the approach in the previous task failed in the upper region of the background, which was not covered with blue sheets, for which we provided the `mask`. To handle more complex scenarios, extend the background model to a per-pixel model. For each pixel, compute the mean and the covariance of its values over a number of frames which do not contain foreground objects. You may then use the Mahalanobis distance to classify pixels in sequences containing foreground objects. You can use the same threshold for all pixels.<br>\n",
    "To create the model, use jugglingBG.avi. This scene was captured for several frames without foreground objects. Based on the background model, foreground pixels can then be identified and masks can be created for jugglingTest.avi."

    "## Useful information for this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are represented as numpy arrays, which are fixed-dimensional arrays. Videos are represented as arrays of images.<br>\n",
    "In this tutorial each pixel takes a RGB value within the range [0-255] and is represented as a 16-bit signed integer, to allow signed operations without subtle overflow bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "you will need to visualize your results, thus to printout an image use:\n",
    "\n",
    "`imshow(image)`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read pixel values inside an image by accessing the corresponding pixel coordinates in the array. The following reads the green component (1) of pixel at location (10, 20) of the 5th frame (index 4):\n",
    "\n",
    "`g = vid[4, 10, 20, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you can also change pixel values in the same way. We recommend copying an image before editing. To copy an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "`im_copy = np.array(im)` (`np` is the short name for `numpy` which is recognized by python when importing numpy with `import numpy as np`)\n",
    "\n",
    "With numpy it is also possible to refer to slices of a given array by specifying the kept dimensions in the slice with `:`. For example, if we want to access the red channel of an RGB image `im` with shape `(height, width, 3)`, we can write `im[:, :, 0]`, which refers to the whole image data for the red channel only. We can optionally specify a range to be kept along a direction by writing the extreme indices around the `:` as in `min:max`. For example, accessing a patch within the pixel coordinates `(h0, w0)`, `(h1, w1)` with h0 < h1 and w0 < w1 can be done with `im[h0:h1, w0:w1, :]`.<br>\n",
    "You can also index arrays based on conditions: for example to set to black all pixels with a blue component higher than 200 you can write `im[im[:, :, 2] > 200] = 0`.<br>\n",
    "These references can be used both for reading an image slice and for writing a whole slice at once, without looping over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing operations between numpy arrays, all operations are executed element-wise (except for the `@` operator that performs the usual matrix multiplication). This requires the shapes (dimensions) of the involved arrays to match or to be compatible according to broadcasting rules, which are usually intuitive. An example of broadcasting is when adding a pixel value `p=np.array([70, 128, 255])` to an image `im` with shape `(height, width, 3)`: the operation is legal and the pixel value is added independently to each pixel in the image. A complete reference of numpy broadcasting rules (not necessary for this tutorial, but very useful for numpy python programming) can be found in https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html . \n",

    "In the following we list some useful functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "`np.array(a)`: returns a copy of `a` as a numpy array. Argument `a` does not need to be a numpy array, it can be any array-like object, e.g. a python list. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html<br>\n",
    "`np.empty(shape, dtype)`: returns a new empty array with specified shape `shape` and the specified data type `dtype`. For this tutorial we suggest using as dtype `np.int16` for images and default for the rest. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.empty.html<br>\n",
    "`np.ones(shape, dtype)`: returns a new array filled with ones with specified shape `shape` and the specified data type `dtype`.

For this tutorial we suggest using as dtype `np.int16` for images and default for the rest. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html<br>\n",
    "`np.eye(N)` : builds the identity matrix of order `N`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.eye.html<br>\n",
    "`np.reshape(a, newshape)`: returns a reshaped view of the input array `a` having shape `newshape`, which should be specified as a tuple of integers. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html<br>\n",
    "`np.linalg.norm(x)`: returns the L2 norm of array `x`. You can also specify a keyword argument `axis` to compute the norm only along a specific dimension (the result will have the same shape as `x`, but without the specified dimension) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html<br>\n",
    "`np.transpose(a)` : returns the transposed of array `a`, whose shape has reversed order with respect to `a`. Alias `a.T`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.transpose.html<br>\n",
    "`np.linalg.inv(a)` : returns the multiplicative inverse of matrix `a`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.inv.html<br>\n",
    "`np.matmul(a, b)` : returns the matrix multiplication of `a` multiplied by `b`. Alias `a @ b`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html<br>\n",
    "`np.sum(a)` : returns the sum of all the elements of array `a`. You can specify a keyword argument `axis` to compute the sum only along a specific dimension (the result will have the same shape as `a`, but without the specified dimension) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html<br>\n",
    "`np.mean(a)` : returns the mean value of all the elements of array `a`. You can specify a keyword argument `axis` to compute the mean only along a specific dimension (the result will have the same shape as `a`, but without the specified dimension) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html<br>\n",
    "`np.cov(m)` : build the covariance matrix of array `a` where each row represents a variable and each column represents an observation.  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html <br>\n",
